# Comment Replies:
Nano Tipper is intended for tipping on reddit posts and replies. On any [tracked subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nano_tipper/comments/lp252z/tipper_subreddits_and_status/) you can tip and type a message like:

    !ntip 0.01 This is great!

This will tip a redditor 0.01 Nano. `!ntip AMOUNT` must be the first thing in your message OR the last thing. Such, this is also a valid tip:

    This is great! !ntip 0.01

Or from anywhere on reddit, you can tip a commenter by:

    /u/nano_tipper 0.01 This is great!
   
or

    This is great! /u/nano_tipper 0.01

Even specify a currency!

    !ntip 1USD Enjoy a dollar!

If the subreddit is a [friendly subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nano_tipper/comments/lp252z/tipper_subreddits_and_status/) (which correlates to [tracked subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nano_tipper/comments/lp252z/tipper_subreddits_and_status/)), the bot will respond with a message. If the subreddit is not tracked, there is a $1USD minimum and the bot will send PMs instead of responding. If the subreddit is marked as "silent", PMs will be sent.



    !nanocenter AMOUNT PROJECT

such as

    !nanocenter 1 unity
    
for a list of NanoCenter projects, see the PM commands below.
    
# Private Messages

Nano Tipper also works by PM (NOT CHAT). [Send a message](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=nano_tipper&subject=hi&message=type_command_here) to /u/nano_tipper for a variety of actions.

To send 0.1 Nano to zily88, include this text in the message body:

    send 0.1 /u/zily88
-or-

    send 0.1 zily88

To send 0.1 Nano to nano\_1ssr4sbop5wnkbkpk7y7ekewie7tygtjgdukm9jq7d1m3j6ocfskwyx77awd, include this text in the message body:

or send all your balance:

There are many other commands.

'opt-in' - Reenables your account. Your Nano may or may not still be available. 
```
### Activate the TipBot on Your Subreddit
If you are a moderator of a subreddit, and would like to tipping to your sub, use the `subreddit` command. For example, for me to activate tipping on my /r/nano_tipper subreddit, I send a PM to the bot saying:

`subreddit nano_tipper activate`

This will allow the bot to look for !ntip commands and respond to posts. 
-or- If I don't want the bot to respond, but still want tips:

`subreddit nano_tipper activate silent`

-or- for a cleaner tipbot response:

`subreddit nano_tipper activate minimal`

To deactivate, simply PM:

`subreddit nano_tipper deactivate`

To set a minimum, specify like so:

`subreddit nano_tipper minimum 1`

# Terms of Service
* Don't keep a lot of Nano in your Nano Tip Bot account
* You accept the risks of using this Tip Bot--While I have no intention of stealing your Nanos, they might be lost at any point, and I'm under no obligation to replace them. Don't put in more than you're willing to lose.
* If your account is inactive for more than 3 years, and no meaningful attempt has been made to reach me, the Nanos in your account will be forfeited and I am under no obligation to return them. Why did I write this? Because the tip bot is not a lifelong custodian service -- I don't want people reaching out to me after years for their Nanos the left on the tip bot. I don't want to have to keep the database with me the rest of my life. That being said, if the bot is still running in 3 years, your Nano is more than likely available.
* Don't submit more than 5 requests every 30 seconds. The bot will ignore any commands you issue until 30 seconds have passed.
* I can change the Terms of Service at any time.

# FAQ
## Why does the message have to start or end with !ntip?
This is to prevent unintentional tips! If the program simply scanned the entire comment, a user might accidentally quote someone else's tip command in a response. In the future I might change this, but for now it's the best way to ensure the program behaves as expected.

## Are my funds safe?
**NO! Unless you and you alone control your private keys, your funds are never safe!** Please don't keep more than a few Nanos on the tipbot at any time! This program is a hobby project, not a battle tested exchange. Bad things can happen, including lost Nanos! **Use at your own risk!**

## I sent a tip to the wrong address. Can I get it back?
If the address isn't affiliated with a redditor, **No.** I only have private keys for redditors, not for addresses. If you send Nano to Binance for example, I cannot retrieve it.

## I sent a tip to the wrong redditor. Can I get it back?
You basically gave a stranger a dollar, and I have no control over that. Yes, I technically control the private keys, but I really don't want to start manually making unauthorized transactions on people's accounts. If the stranger is a redditor and doesn't activate their account, you will get your tip back in 30 days. If they *do* activate their account, it's theirs. You can try asking them for it back.

## Have you implemented any spam prevention for your bot?
Users are allowed 5 requests every 30 seconds. If you do more than that, the bot ignores you until 30 seconds have passed.

## I tried to send a tip, but received no response. Did it go through?
Probably not. It's most likely the bot was temporarily disconnected. If a command is issued while the bot is offline, the command will not be seen. If no response is received from the bot after a few minutes, send a message to the bot with the text 'history'. If you get a response and the tip isn't in your history, that means it wasn't seen. If you don't get a response, the bot is probably still offline. Try again in a few minutes.

## I found a bug or I have a concern. Question Mark?
Send /u/zily88 a PM on reddit, or post on https://reddit.com/r/nano_tipper
