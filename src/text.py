HELP = """
Help from Nano Tipper! This bot handles tips via the Nano currency.
[Visit us on GitHub](https://github.com/danhitchcock/nano_tipper_z), the [Wiki](http://reddit.com/r/nano_tipper/wiki/) 
or /r/nano_tipper for more information on its use and its status. Be sure to read the 
[Terms of Service](https://github.com/danhitchcock/nano_tipper_z#terms-of-service)\n\n

If you do not accept the Terms of Service, or do not with to participate, please respond with the text `opt-out`.\n\n

Nano Tipper works in two ways -- either publicly tip a user on a subreddit, or send a PM to /u/nano_tipper with a PM command below.\n\n
To tip 0.1 Nano on a comment or post on a [tracked subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/nano_tipper/comments/astwp6/nano_tipper_status/), make a comment starting with:\n
    !nano_tip 0.1
    -or-
    !ntip 0.1\n
To tip anywhere on reddit, tag the bot as such (it won't post on the all subreddits, but it will PM the users):\n
    /u/nano_tipper 0.1
You can tip any amount above the program minimum of 0.0001 Nano.\n\n
Also, you can specify a currency, like USD:\n
    !ntip 1USD\n

For PM commands, create a new message with any of the following commands (be sure to remove the quotes, '<'s and '>'s):\n
    'create' - Create a new account if one does not exist
    'send <amount or all> <user/address>' - Send Nano to a reddit user or an address
    'balance' or 'address' - Retrieve your account balance. Includes both pocketed and unpocketed transactions
    'minimum <amount>' - (default 0.0001) Sets a minimum amount for receiving tips
    'silence <yes/no>' - (default 'no') Prevents the bot from sending you tip notifications or tagging in posts 
    'history <optional: number of records>' - Retrieves tipbot commands. Default 10, maximum is 50.
    'percentage <percent>' - (default 10 percent) Sets a percentage of returned tips to donate to TipBot development.
    'convert <amountcurrency>' - Calculates the Nano value of the specified curency. e.g. `convert 1USD`. Also works with "price" and "value".
    'opt-out' - Disables your account and donates your remaining Nano to the tipbot. 
    'opt-in' - Reenables your account. Your Nano may or may not still be available. 
    'help' - Get this help message\n
If you wanted to send 0.01 Nano to zily88, reply:\n
    send 0.01 zily88\n
If you have any questions or bug fixes, please contact /u/zily88."""
